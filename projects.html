									<h2>Distributed Small Cell Technology Using Light Poles</h2>
									<h4>Spring 2017 - Fall 2017</h4>
									<p>For senior design, our electrical and mechanical engineering teams worked under Eaton. We mapped out the mechanical installation of a 5G small cell with MIMO, mmWave, SigFox/LoRa, LTE, and Wi-Fi coverage on a light pole. Also, we simulated radiation patterns of dipole and patch antennas with our MATLAB GUI. Then, we performed wireless link budget analysis and identified the antenna and transmitters' power consumptions.</p>

									<h2>VIP: Intelligent Tutoring System</h2>
									<h4>Spring 2016 - Fall 2016</h4>
									<p>I participated in the Intelligent Tutoring System team under Dr. James McClellan for two semesters. For the first semester, my partner and I converted a MATLAB discrete convolution GUI into an online version using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSXGraph, and GITHUB for ECE 2026 students to use. For the second semester, we resurrected the mobile app created by a team in a previous semester on PhoneGap and enhanced the app with a performance review functionality using SQL and PHP.</p>

									<h2>Power Flow Analysis Using Newton-Raphson Method</h2>
									<h4>Fall 2017</h4>
									<p>For my term project in ECE 4320, I analyzed a six bus system and wrote the power flow equations for this system. Then, I wrote a MATLAB program to perform three iterations of the algorithm to solve the power flow problem. After, I remodeled the generator as a source of real and reactive power and solved the new power flow problem.</p>

									<h2>Wireless Networks</h2>
									<h4>Fall 2017</h4>
									<p>We analyzed the unified architecture for design and evaluation of fair-queuing algorithms, and we also analyzed standards on mobility support in IPv6. For those two projects, we wrote a report and created a presentation for the class. THe final project involved conducting simulations to compare the performance of TCP Taho, Reno, NewReno, and Sack in a network with 7 nodes and 2 TCP flows, analyzing a real trace of network traffic, and deploying Wi-Fi analysis.</p>

									<h2>Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications</h2>
									<h4>Spring 2017</h4>
									<p>I wrote a final report addressing the concept of V2V communications, how it works, what technologies and techniques are used, as well as limitations and concerns regarding this technology. The report also includes MATLAB software simulation results that I recreated from another research paper. I duplicated simulation results of the BER vs SNR in a low level of disruption environment for BPSK, PSK, QPSK, 8-QAM, and 16-QAM to compare performance rates.</p>

									<h2>100 uF Electrolytic Capacitor</h2>
									<h4>Fall 2016</h4>
									<p>I wrote a final report analyzing the 100 Î¼F capacitor by discussing its various aspects and providing functionality and limitations of the circuit element. Different parasitics and its limitation effects on the operation of the capacitor is then analyzed.</p>

									<h2>DE2 Bot - Implementing Sonar to Detect Objects</h2>
									<h4>Spring 2016</h4>
									<p>We designed and programmed an implementation on the DE2 Bot that detects and locates objects using ultrasonic range finding. We used a simple approach and had the robot move along the center column of the arena and scan left and right for objects. Although it's unable to detect all the objects in the arena with our algorithm, it worked well enough to detect and locate at least half of the objects in the arena.</p>

									<h2>Microbial Fuel Cell</h2>
									<h4>Fall 2012 - Spring 2013</h4>
									<p>My partner and I constructed several models of a salt-bridge microbial fuel cell and altered independent variables to determine voltage and current produced at a local waste plant. Originally, we tried to produce bioethanol from food waste before changing to sewage waste.</p>

									<h2>Websites and Games</h2>
									<h4>Fall 2012 - Spring 2014</h4>
									<p>Ever since I took web development and programming classes in high school, I started to work on projects outside of class. I coded and designed unpublished hobby related websites, created simple games with the Game-maker program, and made several functional Java programs.</p>
